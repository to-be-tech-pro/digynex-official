# 🛠️ 02: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & SECURITY REPORT
## DigyNex 360 Ecosystem (2026 Edition)

### 🏗️ 1. SYSTEM TOPOLOGY
The DigyNex 360 ecosystem is built on a **Modular Micro-Services Architecture**, ensuring horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.

*   **Frontend Engine:** Vue 3 (Composition API) with Tailwind CSS for high-fidelity, reactive UI/UX.
*   **Database Backbone:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) providing real-time synchronization and secure data storage.
*   **Automation Engine:** Enterprise-grade n8n cluster for ETL pipelines and cross-platform integrations.
*   **AI Models:** Deep integration with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and Imagen 4.0 for generative intelligence & forecasting.

### 🛡️ 2. SECURITY & SOVEREIGNTY (Zero-Trust)
Security is at the foundation of the DigyNex architecture.
*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Granular permissions ensuring data isolation between departments.
*   **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based access for all API endpoints.
*   **Docker Containerization:** Applications are deployed in isolated containers, allowing for easy **On-Premise Deployment** for high-security clients.
*   **Encryption:** AES-256 encryption for flight-data and PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

### ⚡ 3. THE "PROJECT NEXUS" ETL PIPELINE
Project Nexus uses an asynchronous processing model to handle high-volume data ingestion.
*   **Parser Engine:** Automatically identifies data schemas from CSV, PDF, and Excel formats.
*   **Validation Layer:** Cross-references incoming data against Master Ledgers to prevent duplication or errors.
*   **Financial Integrity:** Immutable transaction logs for every bulk-import event, supporting SCV (Strategic Cost Variance) audits.

---

### 🌐 4. INTEGRATION NODE (FB Nexus)
Our proprietary integration layer allows for deep-syncing with social ecosystems.
*   **Meta Graph API Integration:** Directly interacts with Facebook for automated lead capture.
*   **Webhooks:** Real-time triggers from external 3rd party apps (WhatsApp, Telegram) to the central CRM.

### 📊 5. SCALING CAPABILITIES
The system is designed to scale dynamically from **500 to 1,000,000+ active profiles** without database latency, thanks to PostgreSQL indexing strategies.
